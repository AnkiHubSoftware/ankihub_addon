## Description
<!--
Describe what needs to be done with details. You can write some short paragraphs or use a bullet point list.

E.g.:
- This needs to be done
- This also should be done

We also have to change the styling of the homepage because it needs a new styling. We should make the background pink and all fonts red. Users will love it.
-->


## Project / Parent issue
<!--
Link here the Notion project if this is a project issue or the parent issue if this is a subtask of a project spec.

e.g.:
- [Make it evident the benefits of becoming a member](https://www.notion.so/ankipalace/...)

or link with the issue number:
- #0000
-->

Add here any resources and media that might help addressing the task, like:

## Tasks
<!--
If this is a parent issue (project) create your subtasks here. Hint: write them using checkbox items and then after creating the issue, use the "convert to issue" button that will appear when hovering over the list item, and github will create the issue automatically.

e.g.:
- [ ] Change the explore page background to pink
- [ ] Change all font color to red
- [ ] Drop the whole database in production
