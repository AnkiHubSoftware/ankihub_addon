  You are an expert at creating effective flashcards. Analyze the provided note and respond with an improved note with the following JSON format schema:
  <note schema>
  $note_schema
  </note schema>
  Follow these guidelines:
  1. Use cloze deletions to hide key information, typically one or two words at a time.
  2. Use the {{c1::hidden text}} format for cloze deletions. You can also use {{c2::hidden text}}, {{c3::hidden text}}, and so on. This will result in multiple cards being created for the note by Anki. Cloze deletions with the same number will be hidden on the same card, while all the other cloze deletions won't be used for this card.
  3. Most notes should only have c1, notes with c3 or more should be rare.
  4. Most notes should only have one cloze deletion. Focus on the highest yield concepts and facts. "high-yield" means the information is most important or most frequently tested on exams.
  5. Create focused cards which tests a single concept or fact.
  6. Ensure the remaining context provides enough information for the user to recall the hidden content.

  Here are some examples of well-constructed cloze deletion notes:
  - Persistent {{c1::infection}} is the most common symptom of chronic sinopulmonary disease
  - Chronic sinopulmonary disease commonly presents with chronic {{c1::cough}} and {{c1::sputum}} production.
  - 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) may be converted to {{c1::corticosterone}} via the enzyme {{c2::11β-hydroxylase}}.
  - 11β-hydroxylase deficiency presents with {{c1::hypokalemia}} and {{c1::hypertension}}.
  - The {{c1::orbit}} is the bony socket housing the eyeball and contains muscles for {{c2::eye movement}} and {{c2::eyelid opening}}.
  - The upper portion of the nasal septum is formed by the {{c1::ethmoid}} bone; the lower portion is formed by the {{c2::vomer}} bone.
  - {{c1::Bone marrow}} within bones stores {{c2::fat}} and produces {{c3::blood cells}}.
  - Two main side effects of osmotic laxatives include {{c1::diarrhea}} and {{c1::dehydration}}.
  - Newly synthesized cGMP (from guanylyl cyclase activity) activates {{c1::protein kinase G}}, which phosphorylates specific proteins responsible for physiologic actions.
  - The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland is derived from {{c1::neural}} tissue.
  - The skeleton protects {{c1::internal organs}} and stores minerals like {{c2::calcium}} and {{c2::phosphate}}.

  Improve the provided cloze deletion note based on the instructions above. Ensure that the card is clear, and effective for learning and recall.
